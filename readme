To Do List based on a node backend and a mongodb database that's hosted live using heroku and the mongodb atlas service The link to access the app -> https://polar-coast-96761.herokuapp.com/ This is the home route or the root route that gives current date as a heading. In this app we can make custom routes for example we can make separate lists for /work and /school routes and those routes are gonna get rendered dynamically The atlas server where we are storing the database is hosted on -> https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/62ac976db10a161185442836#metrics/replicaSet/62ac98c2cac5252913c7b96f/explorer/todolistDB/lists/find and while adding we can see live changes on the lists collection of the todolistDB database and we can see the new entries in terms of objects having the name and id as fields
